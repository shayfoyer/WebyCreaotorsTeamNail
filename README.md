# Anastasiya Ganeeva

We've developed a website for Anastasiya Ganeeva's nail salon, aimed at assisting both her existing customers and newcomers in discovering her services. This project serves as a conclusion to our portfolio at Weby Creator Team, and we utilized React in its development

## Challenges

We encountered several challenges during our project. Initially, we attempted to integrate Google Translator to enable the page's translation from Russian, aiming to reach a broader customer base.
Unfortunately, the translation disappeared after refreshing or navigating to a new page. Despite extensive internet research, we couldn't find a solution to fix this issue. We experimented with relocating the function and script, but to no avail. We're determined to explore alternative solutions in the near future.

Additionally, we faced difficulty creating separate components for the home: one for mobile view and another for computer and tablet displays. Initially, this seemed unsolvable, but our quest for answers led us to 'react-responsive.' This tool enabled us to utilize queries and 'useMedia' to identify the current view.

As a newly formed team with no prior collaborative experience, this project marked our maiden successful deployment. Despite the challenges, it's been a valuable learning experience for us.
